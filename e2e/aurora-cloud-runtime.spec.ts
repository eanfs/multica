/**
 * Aurora-on-Fleet end-to-end (Task 7, browser half).
 *
 * Gated on MULTICA_RUN_DOCKER_INTEGRATION=1 before any API or Docker access and
 * excluded from the default Playwright project, so a normal browser run never
 * talks to a Fleet host. Physical execution requires the owned managed
 * environment; a skip is not a pass.
 *
 * The behaviour under test is the browser flow: TestApiClient only signs in and
 * resolves the workspace (setup/teardown), then the Aurora Create directory
 * opens the composer, the prompt is typed and submitted in the UI, and the
 * generation's rendered status badge and artifact link are the evidence. No API
 * call creates or polls the generation. The same flow stays a real-engine skip
 * until the managed environment carries a fake-capable dual-contract node image
 * (the Go half names that prerequisite in aurora_test.go).
