 * Shown after a successful sign-in that left the account without a workspace.
 *
 * Registration opens a personal workspace server-side on every login and the
 * attempt is idempotent, so this is a state that resolves itself on the next
 * sign-in rather than one the user configures their way out of. Aurora serves
 * no workspace-creation route — the account model is one personal space,
 * decided by the server — so signing in again is the whole recovery, and the
 * button does exactly that instead of offering a form that would be a second,
 * divergent way to create the same thing.
