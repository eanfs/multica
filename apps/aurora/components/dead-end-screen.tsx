 * The app's two dead ends — a slug that names no workspace, and a URL that

 * reason, and the ways out.

 * They share the component rather than the copy because the recovery below is
 * the part that must not drift: both branches leave the user in exactly the
 * same position, so a screen that offered a different way out — or none —
 * would strand half the people who reach it.
