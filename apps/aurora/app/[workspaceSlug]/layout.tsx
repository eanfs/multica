 * whose `onboarded_at` is null to the Multica questionnaire, which exists to
 * set up a workspace for coding agents; a consumer opening a poster maker has
 * nothing to answer there, and no Aurora endpoint requires it. Every other
 * rule — auth, slug resolution, the header the first child query will send —
 * is the same one web enforces, and is enforced the same way.
