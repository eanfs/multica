// The cache default is `staleTime: Infinity` (packages/core/query-client.ts),

// that: a generation's status and its assets change server-side while the user
// is on another screen, and with an infinite stale-time the mount-time and
// reconnect refetches never fire, leaving only the mutation invalidations. The
// queries below that can drift on their own therefore set a stale-time; the
// catalog, which is a server-side constant (`aurora/catalog.go`), keeps the
// default.
//
// Most `data` below is a `ParseResult`: the payload plus whether the body it
// came from was readable. A degraded read is *not* an error state — nothing
// threw, so `isError` stays false — which means a view that only checks
// `isError` renders the fallback as the response. Views combine the two with
// `isAuroraDegraded` (./api). The plan and the pack catalog are the exception:
// their parsers throw on a malformed body, so those queries surface a real
// error state instead.
