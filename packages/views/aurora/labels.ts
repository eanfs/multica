/**
 * How the catalog's and the server's vocabulary reaches the screen.
 *
 * Two things live here, both of them about picking a label rather than
 * rendering one:
 *
 *  - The server enums, mapped onto the locale keys that name them. Both are
 *    deliberately open on the wire — the schemas keep them `z.string()` so a
 *    value from a newer server still parses — so each mapping ends in a
 *    fallback instead of assuming this build has seen every value. Without it a
 *    new status would render as an undefined label rather than as "Unknown".
 *  - The catalog's bilingual skill names, picked for the reader's language.
 *
 * Each mapping returns a *key segment*, not copy. Callers index the bundle with
 * it under the namespace that owns the label: `aurora.composer.status.*` for a
 * generation status, `billing.transaction.kind.*` for a ledger kind.
