 * "This screen could not be read, and here is the way back."
 *
 * The three Aurora surfaces each fail the same way — one or more of their reads
 * errored before there was anything to show — so the state they render is one
 * component rather than three copies free to drift apart in tone, role or
 * recovery. Only the title differs, because only the title names what failed.
 *
 * A failed read over data the screen already has is *not* this state: the
 * caller keeps rendering what it read and says nothing here, since replacing a
 * filled screen with an error is a worse trade than showing it stale.
