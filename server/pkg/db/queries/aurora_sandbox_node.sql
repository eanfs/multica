-- Aurora managed sandbox node lifecycle (Plan A Task 1). One node row per
-- workspace, created unbound and later claimed by a single managed daemon.
-- Uniqueness is enforced by migrations 519-526, not by an ON CONFLICT arbiter:
-- every insert here carries a fresh node id, workspace id, runtime id, and
-- daemon id, and the unique indexes are the write-time arbiters.

-- name: CreateAuroraSandboxNode :one
-- Inserts one sandbox node with every identity and lifecycle field written
-- explicitly. last_active_at/created_at/updated_at fall back to their column
-- defaults. The workspace/runtime/daemon unique indexes (521-523) reject a
-- second live node for any of those identities.
