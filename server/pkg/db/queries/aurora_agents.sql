-- The seed must key on system_key alone. Migration 172's partial unique index

-- (UnbindUserAgentsFromRuntime sets runtime_id = NULL for kind = 'user'), an
-- insert-first seed sees a different tuple, inserts a second row, and leaves
-- GetAgentBySystemKey (archived_at IS NULL, ORDER BY created_at ASC) resolving
-- the older, unbound one: the workspace shows duplicate Aurora agents and a
-- generation binds to a carrier with no runtime. Adopting the earliest row keeps
-- the seed's identity identical to the one that lookup resolves.
